                <h1>Brigadeiro origins</h1> <br>
                
                Jokes apart, brigadeiro is a candy with an interesting story. <br>

                Right after WW2, while Rio de Janeiro was still Brazil’s capital, the country was busy with the reelection of the new president.

                One of the candidates, Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, besides being quite charming, was considered a handsome man by the female voters, who were finally allowed to vote in 1932.

                To show their candidate support, these voters prepared sweets to serve in rallies and public meetings.

                Mind you, brigadeiro was named after the candidate’s title, brigadier, but in Portuguese.

                But because it was a post-war period, the country was still rationing many ingredients and products.

                And instead of using milk and sugar, as in most desserts, Heloísa Nabuco de Olivera–the creator of brigadeiro–used sweetened condensed milk to prepare this delicious Brazilian sweet.
